# React UI Migration Plan: Super Polished Foil Lab

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the migration from the current Streamlit-based UI to a modern, polished React application that maintains feature parity while dramatically improving user experience, performance, and maintainability.

## Current State Analysis

### Streamlit Features to Migrate
1. **Core Analysis Page**
   - GPX file upload with drag & drop
   - Real-time parameter adjustment (wind direction, angle tolerance, etc.)
   - Wind direction override with algorithm comparison
   - Track map visualization with VMG highlighting
   - Polar performance diagrams
   - Segment analysis table with filtering
   - Performance statistics and VMG calculations
   - Export to gear comparison

2. **Gear Comparison Page**
   - Bulk track upload
   - Comparative performance analysis
   - Data management and export

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Automatic wind direction refinement
   - Suspicious segment detection
   - Tack analysis (port/starboard)
   - Wind direction lines on map
   - Real-time recalculation pipeline

### Existing React Implementation Status
- ✅ Basic Next.js setup with TypeScript
- ✅ File upload functionality
- ✅ API integration foundation
- ✅ Configuration loading
- ❌ Interactive visualizations
- ❌ Advanced parameter controls
- ❌ Map integration
- ❌ Gear comparison features

## Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- **Client State**: Zustand for UI state (filters, selected segments, etc.)
- **Server State**: TanStack Query (React Query) for API calls with caching
- **Form State**: React Hook Form for parameter controls

## Migration Strategy

### Parallel Development
- Keep Streamlit app running during development
- A/B test individual features as they're completed
- Gradual user migration with feedback collection

- No data migration needed (stateless application)
- Export/import functionality for user configurations
- Session state preservation during transition

### Deployment Strategy
- Deploy React app to separate subdomain initially
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Implement analytics to track usage patterns
- Plan for seamless DNS cutover

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Set up enhanced project structure and design system
2. **Week 1**: Begin Phase 1 development with core components
3. **Ongoing**: Regular user testing and feedback collection
4. **Long-term**: Plan for advanced features like real-time collaboration

This migration will transform Foil Lab from a functional Streamlit app into a best-in-class React application that sets the standard for sailing analysis tools.
